# ContactEmbedView
This repo contains a contact picker view of your contacts . It looks like the gmail's equivalent.

This is a free repo under development


This UI component will work to select contacts from our the Android user agenda and show it on a beaultiful way (like Gmail App does when you are composing an email).

Basically we have two approaches:

1 - When you need only select one contact.

The gif below shows the current state of our component.

2 -  When you need select more than one contact.

Under development.. please, be patient.
